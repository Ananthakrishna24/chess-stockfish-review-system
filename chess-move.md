Chess.com employs a detailed classification system to evaluate and label each move in a game review. This system combines engine evaluations with specific criteria to provide players with insights into the quality and impact of their moves. Here's an in-depth explanation of how these classifications work:

### üéØ Core Move Classifications

Chess.com utilizes an **Expected Points Model** to assess the quality of each move. This model calculates a player's probability of winning based on their rating and the engine's evaluation of the position. The change in expected points before and after a move determines its classification:([support.chess.com][1])

* **Best**: The move that maintains or improves the player's expected points without any loss.

* **Excellent**: A move that results in a minimal decrease in expected points (up to 0.02), indicating it's nearly as good as the best move.([chess.com][2])

* **Good**: A move with a slight decrease in expected points (between 0.02 and 0.05), still maintaining a solid position.

* **Inaccuracy**: A move causing a moderate drop in expected points (between 0.05 and 0.10), suggesting a suboptimal choice.

* **Mistake**: A move leading to a significant decrease in expected points (between 0.10 and 0.20), worsening the player's position.([chess.com][2])

* **Blunder**: A move that results in a substantial drop in expected points (over 0.20), often leading to a losing position.

These thresholds help players understand the impact of their decisions during the game. ([support.chess.com][1])

### üåü Special Move Classifications

Beyond the core categories, Chess.com identifies certain moves with special labels based on their strategic or tactical significance:

* **Brilliant**: A move that involves a good piece sacrifice, leading to a significant advantage. Criteria include:

  * The move is the best or nearly the best in the position.
  * The player is not in a bad position after the move.
  * The player is not already in a completely winning position.
  * The definition is more generous for newer players compared to higher-rated players. ([support.chess.com][1])

* **Great**: A move that significantly alters the course of the game, such as turning a losing position into an equal one or finding the only good move in a position. ([support.chess.com][1])

* **Miss**: A move where the player fails to capitalize on the opponent's mistake, missing the opportunity to gain a winning position. ([support.chess.com][1])

* **Book**: A move that is part of established opening theory, commonly played in professional games. ([support.chess.com][3])

### üîç Additional Insights

* **Accuracy Score**: Chess.com provides an accuracy score ranging from 0 to 100, representing how closely a player's moves align with the engine's recommendations. A higher score indicates more precise play. ([support.chess.com][3])

* **Game Review Settings**: Players can customize which move classifications are highlighted during analysis by adjusting the settings in the game review interface. ([support.chess.com][4])

* **Engine Depth Variability**: The classification of moves can sometimes change upon deeper engine analysis. A move initially labeled as "Great" might be reclassified as "Brilliant" or vice versa when the engine evaluates the position more thoroughly.&#x20;
