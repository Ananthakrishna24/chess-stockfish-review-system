# Expected Points (EP) Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a sophisticated chess move categorization system based on the **Expected Points (EP) model**. Unlike traditional centipawn-based analysis, the EP model calculates win probability by considering both the engine evaluation and the player's rating, providing more accurate and realistic move assessments.

## Core Concept

The Expected Points model answers the question: *"What is the probability that this player will win from this position?"*

### Formula
```
ExpectedPoints = 1 / (1 + exp(-adjusted_evaluation))
```

Where:
- `adjusted_evaluation = (evaluation_centipawns / 100) * rating_factor`
- `rating_factor` is calculated based on player skill level

### Rating Factor Calculation
- **Base Rating**: 1200 (factor = 1.0)
- **Higher Rating**: Better conversion of advantages (factor > 1.0)
- **Lower Rating**: Worse conversion of advantages (factor < 1.0)
- **Range**: 0.5 to 2.0

## Algorithm Implementation

### 1. Core Services

#### `ExpectedPointsService`
- Calculates win probabilities using the sigmoid function
- Handles rating-based adjustments
- Provides move accuracy calculations
- Manages classification thresholds

#### `MoveCategorizer`
- Implements sophisticated move classification
- Detects brilliant moves with sacrifice analysis
- Identifies book moves from opening theory
- Provides contextual move reasoning

#### `EnhancedAnalysisService`
- Orchestrates the complete EP-based analysis
- Integrates all components
- Provides the main API interface

### 2. Analysis Process

The algorithm follows this step-by-step process for each move:

1. **Evaluate Position Before Move**
   - Load current board state into Stockfish
   - Perform deep analysis (depth 18+)
   - Store evaluation and best move

2. **Calculate Pre-Move Expected Points**
   - Use `CalculateExpectedPoints(evaluation, player_rating)`
   - Normalize evaluation for current player perspective

3. **Apply Player's Actual Move**
   - Update board state with played move

4. **Evaluate Position After Move**
   - Analyze new position with Stockfish
   - Get evaluation from same player's perspective

5. **Calculate Post-Move Expected Points**
   - Compute EP for new position

6. **Determine EP Loss and Accuracy**
   - `ep_loss = ep_before - ep_after`
   - `move_accuracy = (1 - ep_loss) * 100`

7. **Categorize Move**
   - Apply sophisticated classification rules
   - Consider move context and alternatives

### 3. Move Classification System

The algorithm classifies moves in order of precedence:

#### **Book Move** (First 10-15 moves)
- Matches opening theory database
- Low EP loss in opening phase

#### **Brilliant Move (!!)** 
- Very low EP loss (≤ 0.005)
- Involves sound piece sacrifice
- Position not already overwhelmingly winning
- Difficult to find (non-obvious)

#### **Great Move (!)**
- Only move that doesn't significantly worsen position
- Requires analysis of alternatives
- Low EP loss (≤ 0.01)

#### **Best Move**
- Matches engine's top recommendation
- EP loss = 0.00

#### **Excellent Move**
- EP loss ≤ 0.02
- Nearly as good as best move

#### **Good Move**
- EP loss ≤ 0.05
- Minor imperfection

#### **Inaccuracy**
- EP loss ≤ 0.10
- Noticeable position worsening

#### **Mistake**
- EP loss ≤ 0.20
- Significant error

#### **Blunder**
- EP loss > 0.20
- Game-changing mistake

## Usage

### Basic EP Calculation
```go
epsService := NewExpectedPointsService()

// Calculate win probability for a position
evaluation := 150 // +1.5 pawns
playerRating := 1600
ep := epsService.CalculateExpectedPoints(evaluation, playerRating)
// Result: ~0.65 (65% win probability)
```

### Enhanced Game Analysis
```go
// Initialize services
enhancedService := NewEnhancedAnalysisService(
    stockfishService, chessService, cacheService, 
    playerService, openingService)

// Analyze game with EP model
options := models.AnalysisOptions{
    Depth: 18,
    PlayerRatings: models.PlayerRatings{
        White: 1800,
        Black: 1600,
    },
}

response, err := enhancedService.AnalyzeGameWithEP(pgn, options, progressCallback)
```

### Integration with Existing System
```go
// The enhanced analysis is automatically used when player ratings are provided
analysisService := NewAnalysisService(stockfish, chess, cache, player, opening)

// This will use EP-based analysis if ratings are provided
gameID := analysisService.StartGameAnalysis(pgn, options)
```
